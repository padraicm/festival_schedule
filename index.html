                  (Australia, 79 min) Directed by Jordan Osmond – A community in Australia comes together to explore and demonstrate a simpler way to live in response to global crises. Throughout the year the group built tiny houses, planted veggie gardens, practised simple living, and learned how to live in community.

                <title>Fallow Land Bears Sweet Fruit</title>
                  (China, 24 min) Directed by Andrew Francisco – Can the ideas of early socialism guide China to a more sustainable future? This is a character-driven documentary about ‘China’s first intentional community,’ and how some young people here are reinterpreting the legacy of living together. Tang Guanhua and Xingzhen are young luminaries of a nascent Back to the Land movement. Their vision could be an important new direction for Chinese society, or a self-indulgent escape for a privileged few. This experiment in living socialism has been preceded by many notable successes and failures. Can such a commune thrive within the world’s largest socialist state? http://www.fallowlandbearssweetfruit.com/

Heath Ledger "fully conceived [it] down to the last detail" but it was unfinished at the time of his death. The LA art collective 'The Masses' helped complete the video. The video was designed "to raise awareness on modern whaling practices." The video contains fairly graphic animated scenes, but it delivers and hopefully cements the message in people's minds.

                  <title>Cruelty Doesn’t Suit Me</title> Actor Joaquin Phoenix is a known advocate for animals and longtime vegan, and he has already tackled the barbaric leather industry, famously donning vegan leather to play the role of Johnny Cash. In a beautiful ad shot by Michael Muller, Joaquin turns his focus to wool, admitting that he didn’t previously realize how cruel its production is. Whether suits are for work or play, they do not need to involve wool. Cruelty-free fabrics are becoming more and more available every day. For his PETA ad, Joaquin was outfitted by Brave GentleMan in clothing made from cutting edge, vegan materials such as “future-wool.” Sheep are known for being docile, gentle animals, which makes their abuse even more unbearable to imagine. Just like cows and dogs in the cruel leather industry and rabbits in the angora industry, sheep raised for wool suffer greatly. The gentle animals are often beaten, kicked, and mutilated so that their wool can be made into sweaters, coats, scarves, gloves, and boots. http://www.peta.org/features/joaquin-phoenix-beautifully-suited/

                  <title>The Fox of Shichigorosawa</title> (Japan, 14 min) Directed by Sugihara Tun – This story is told in the Ainu language, which has been deemed a critically endangered language by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Higashiyama, the home of the foxes, has become an illegal dumping ground. This has resulted in the decline of small animals, which the mother fox relied on as prey to feed her children. The fox comes down for the mountains in search of food to feed her children, and comes upon a human village. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsHajagDIMQ

                  <title>Seasons</title> (France, Germany, 97 min) Directed by Jacques Perrin, Jacques Cluzaud - After traveling the world alongside migrating birds and diving the oceans with whales and manta rays, Jacques Perrin and Jacques Cluzaud return to more familiar ground, the lush green forests and megafauna that emerged across Europe following the last Ice Age. Winter had gone on for 80,000 years when, in a relatively short period of time the ice retreated, the landscape metamorphosed, the cycle of seasons was established and the beasts occupied their new kingdom. It was only later than man arrived to share this habitat, first tentatively as migratory hunter/gatherers, then making inroads in the forest as settled agriculturalists, and later more dramatically via industry and warfare. SEASONS, with its exceptional footage of animals in the wild, is the awe-inspiring and thought-provoking tale of the long and tumultuous shared history that inextricably binds humankind with the natural world. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNZnk_mckxY
