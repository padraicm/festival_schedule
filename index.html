                  (China, 24 min) Directed by Andrew Francisco – Can the ideas of early socialism guide China to a more sustainable future? This is a character-driven documentary about ‘China’s first intentional community,’ and how some young people here are reinterpreting the legacy of living together. Tang Guanhua and Xingzhen are young luminaries of a nascent Back to the Land movement. Their vision could be an important new direction for Chinese society, or a self-indulgent escape for a privileged few. This experiment in living socialism has been preceded by many notable successes and failures. Can such a commune thrive within the world’s largest socialist state? http://www.fallowlandbearssweetfruit.com/

Heath Ledger "fully conceived [it] down to the last detail" but it was unfinished at the time of his death. The LA art collective 'The Masses' helped complete the video. The video was designed "to raise awareness on modern whaling practices." The video contains fairly graphic animated scenes, but it delivers and hopefully cements the message in people's minds.

                  <title>Cruelty Doesn’t Suit Me</title> Actor Joaquin Phoenix is a known advocate for animals and longtime vegan, and he has already tackled the barbaric leather industry, famously donning vegan leather to play the role of Johnny Cash. In a beautiful ad shot by Michael Muller, Joaquin turns his focus to wool, admitting that he didn’t previously realize how cruel its production is. Whether suits are for work or play, they do not need to involve wool. Cruelty-free fabrics are becoming more and more available every day. For his PETA ad, Joaquin was outfitted by Brave GentleMan in clothing made from cutting edge, vegan materials such as “future-wool.” Sheep are known for being docile, gentle animals, which makes their abuse even more unbearable to imagine. Just like cows and dogs in the cruel leather industry and rabbits in the angora industry, sheep raised for wool suffer greatly. The gentle animals are often beaten, kicked, and mutilated so that their wool can be made into sweaters, coats, scarves, gloves, and boots. http://www.peta.org/features/joaquin-phoenix-beautifully-suited/

Higashiyama, the home of the foxes, has become an illegal dumping ground. This has resulted in the decline of small animals, which the mother fox relied on as prey to feed her children. The fox comes down for the mountains in search of food to feed her children, and comes upon a human village. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsHajagDIMQ

                  <title>Seasons</title> (France, Germany, 97 min) Directed by Jacques Perrin, Jacques Cluzaud - After traveling the world alongside migrating birds and diving the oceans with whales and manta rays, Jacques Perrin and Jacques Cluzaud return to more familiar ground, the lush green forests and megafauna that emerged across Europe following the last Ice Age. Winter had gone on for 80,000 years when, in a relatively short period of time the ice retreated, the landscape metamorphosed, the cycle of seasons was established and the beasts occupied their new kingdom. It was only later than man arrived to share this habitat, first tentatively as migratory hunter/gatherers, then making inroads in the forest as settled agriculturalists, and later more dramatically via industry and warfare. SEASONS, with its exceptional footage of animals in the wild, is the awe-inspiring and thought-provoking tale of the long and tumultuous shared history that inextricably binds humankind with the natural world. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNZnk_mckxY

                  (USA, 56 min) Directed by Sheila Gail O'Rourke – Explores contemporary animal rights issues through a focus on a feral cat colony that has survived on a rocky, seaside jetty in Southern California for decades. There is an ongoing debate over feral cat colonies involving advocates who support the trap, neuter, and return -- or "TNR" -- model of management, and those who argue that trapping and euthanizing the cats is more humane. This documentary’s point-of-view supports the TNR model and the related “no-kill” animal shelter policy, and features an exclusive interview with Richard Avanzino, the "Father" of the no-kill movement.

                  (USA, 26 min) Directed by Chris Malloy – Explains the critical role food will play in the next frontier of our efforts to solve the environmental crisis. It explores four areas of agriculture that aim to change our relationship to the land and oceans. Most of our food is produced using methods that reduce biodiversity, decimate soil and contribute to climate change. We believe our food can and should be a part of the solution to the environmental crisis -- grown, harvested and produced in ways that restore our land, water and wildlife. The film tells the story of four groups that are pioneers in the fields of regenerative agriculture, regenerative grazing, diversified crop development and restorative fishing. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWHabbAOON0

These ranchers now know how to regenerate their soils while making their animals healthier and their operations more profitable. They are turning ON their soils, enabling rainwater to sink into the earth rather than run off. And these turned ON soils retain that water, so the ranches are much more resilient in drought. It’s an amazing story that has just begun.

                (USA, 60 min) Directed by James Redford – Researchers have recently discovered a dangerous biological syndrome caused by abuse and neglect during childhood. As this documentary reveals, toxic stress can trigger hormones that wreak havoc on the brains and bodies of children, putting them at greater risk for disease, homelessness, prison time, and early death. While the broader impacts of poverty worsen the risk, no segment of society is immune. This film, however, also chronicles the dawn of a movement that is determined to fight back. Trailblazers in pediatrics, education, and social welfare are using cutting-edge science and field-tested therapies to protect children from the insidious effects of toxic stress--and the dark legacy of a childhood that no child would choose. https://vimeo.com/137282528

The town has registered 16 inches of sea level rise since 1930. But this is not a film about loss and inaction. It tells the stories of citizens from across the United States as they step forward to raise awareness and push their government to solve climate change. https://vimeo.com/180099085

                  Frogs are vanishing in America’s heartland. Canadian beluga whales are mysteriously dying in the Saint Lawrence River. Swarms of sea stars are overrunning parts of Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Are these signals that something is amiss in Earth’s water – from our marshes to the sea? Has water become a massive delivery system for pollutants?  https://vimeo.com/146177242

                  The Forgotten Wisdom of Trees (Canada, 85 min) Directed by Jeff McKay – Diana Beresford-Kroeger’s journey explores our profound biological and spiritual connection to trees. From Japan to California and Ireland to Germany, to Vancouver Island and across to the great Boreal Forest, Diana meets people who are taking the lead in replanting, restoring, and protecting the last of these great ancient forests. As the journey progresses, the film explores the science, folklore, and history of this essential, and often overlooked, ecosystem. Beresford-Kroeger reminds us that when we improve our profound human connection to woodlands we can not only restore our health, we can also restore our planet. https://vimeo.com/185080512

                  <title>Accidental Parkland</title>
                  (Canada, 55 min) Directed by Dan Berman – is a documentary project on the changing nature and sustained value of Toronto’s urban waterways, both the waterfront and ravines. Many people don’t even realize that we all are linked by these indented spaces and the water that flows through them. Development over the last century and a half has engineered, and sometimes buried, the ravines and watercourses out of our sight and mind. When it comes to urban green space and its protection, Toronto is a bit of a marvel. We have, partially by accident, avoided the pitfalls and missteps that many other contemporary cities blundered into when it came to caring for local waterways and preserving natural spaces in the urban context. People come from around the world to see how the Toronto region preserves and manages its watersheds. https://vimeo.com/metaldog/accidentalparkland

                  <title>Rising Tides</title>
                  (USA, 89 min) Directed by Jason Auerbach, Scott Duthie - Rising Tides examines the effects of sea level rise and coastal erosion on the coastlines here in the states and globally. A topic that has much debate. Scientists, politicians, and the everyday person explain the impacts sea levels will have over 10, 50 to 100 years from now, as well as touch on the power of storm surges not just to the coastlines but to important infrastructures. This is an issue with many questions as well as many possible solutions but are we open to the conversation. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eojxdSL58ME
